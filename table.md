About This Resource

Core Definitions
● Open Access (OA) - ​
making peer reviewed scholarly manuscripts freely
available via the Internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy,
distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles, crawl them for
indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any lawful purpose,
without financial, legal or technical barriers other than those inseparable from
gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and
distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give
authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly
acknowledged and cited. May also refer to theses, books, book chapters,
monographs and other content. (​
BOAI​
)
● Open data - ​
making data freely available on the public internet permitting any
user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, pass them to software or use
them for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other

Principles​
)
Open Educational Resources (OER) - ​
high quality, openly licensed, online
educational materials for sharing, use, and reuse. They act as a mechanism for
instructional innovation as networks of teachers and learners share best
practices. (​
Source​
)
Open Source Software (OSS) - ​
availability of source code for a piece of
software, along with an ​
open source license permitting reuse, adaptation, and
further distribution. (​
Wikipedia​
)
Article Processing Charge (APC) ​
- a fee charged to the author, creator, or
institution to cover the cost of an article, rather than charging the potential
reader of the article. APCs may apply to both commercial and Open Access
publications. APCs are sometimes charged to authors in order to cover the cost
of publishing and disseminating an article in an Open Access scholarly journal.
(​
Source​
)
Repository (article) - ​
an archive to deposit manuscripts. These can be
personal, institutional, on websites such as ​
ResearchGate or ​
Academia.edu​
, or
subject-based such as ​
arXiv​
.
Repository (software) - a collection of files managed with version control
software (e.g., bzr, hg, git, csv, svn, etc.). Can be hosted by third-party (e.g.,
github, bitbucket, sourceforge), by an institution, or self-hosted locally.
Institutional Repository ​
- An online database designed to collect the
intellectual output of a particular institution or university, including digital
collections such as electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), pre-prints, or
faculty scholarship, and presents associated metadata regarding the these
items. (​
Source​
)
Embargo period - ​
a length of time imposed on a research output for users
who have not paid for access, or do not have institutional access, before it is
made freely available.
Reproducibility - ​
the similarity between results of a study or experiment and
independent results obtained with the same methods but under different
conditions (i.e., pertains to results).
Repeatability - ​
the similarity between results of a study or experiment and
independent results obtained with the same methods and under identical
conditions (i.e., pertains to methods and analysis).
Publishing - ​
to make a research output available to the public. Commonly
refers to the release of works by publishers, irrespective of whether public
access is granted or not.
Sharing - ​
the joint use of a resource or space. A fundamental aspect of
collaborative research. As most research is digitally-authored &
digitally-published, the resulting digital content is non-rivalrous and can be
shared without any loss to the original creator.
Paywall - ​
restriction via a financial barrier to research, often implemented by
legacy publishers. Can be removed by personal or institutional subscription.
See Loginwall for a barrier that prevents access, without asking for money to
unlock access.
2 

● Funder - ​
an institute, corporation or government body that provides financial
assistance for research.
● Publisher - ​
a company whose purpose is to make the outputs of research
publicly available.
● Creative work - ​
An original, identifiable piece of content, such as an academic
paper, a diagram, a photograph, or a video clip. Owners of creative works have
rights, such as copyright, that they might reserve to keep control of the
content, or relinquish to allow others to share and reuse that content.
● Intellectual property (IP) - ​
a legal term that refers to creations of the mind.
Examples of intellectual property include music, literature, and other artistic
works; discoveries and inventions; and phrases, symbols, and designs.
● Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) ​
- the rights given to the owners of
intellectual property. IPR is protected either automatically (eg copyright, design
rights) or by registering or applying for it (eg trademarks, patents). ​
Protecting
your intellectual property makes it easier to take legal action against anyone
who steals or copies it. IPR can be legally sold, assigned or licenced by the
creator to other parties, or joint-owned.
● Copyright - ​
The aspect of Intellectual property that gives creators the right to
permit (or not permit) what happens to their creations, as opposed to
trademark rights or moral rights.
● Copyleft - ​
a form of licensing that makes a creative work freely available to be
modified, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the creative
work to be free as well. Open Access does not require works to be copyleft, nor
does it necessarily exclude copyleft works from being open access. The
recommended licence (CC-BY) for academic publishing is not copyleft.
● Subscription - ​
a form of business model whereby a fee is paid in order to gain
access to a product or service - in this case, the outputs of scholarly research.
● Toll access - ​
whereby a fee is required to pass a paywall to access research.
● Legacy publisher - ​
a publisher that historically has operated on a
paywall-based​
business model.
​
● Open access publisher - ​
a publisher that publishes all research articles as
open access articles. Most legacy publishers have options to make journals at
least partially open access.
● Open access journal - ​
a journal that exclusively comprises open access
articles.
● Impact - ​
the scale of use of research outputs both inside and outside of
academia.
● Self-archiving - ​
making a copy of a manuscript available through a personal
website, institutional repository, or other repository.
● Scholarly Communication ​
- The creation, transformation, dissemination, and
preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly
endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and
publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider
academic community. The creation, transformation, dissemination, and
preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly
endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and

Depreciated terms
the use of which is not encouraged as they are typically poorly-understood:
● Green OA - ​
making a version of the manuscript freely available in a repository.
● Gold OA ​
- making the final version of manuscript freely available immediately
upon publication by the publisher.
● Gratis OA - the paper is available to read free-of-charge, though its reuse is still
restricted, for example by ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright. (​
source​
)
● Libre OA - ​

● Author Addendum ​
- An author addendum is a supplemental or added
agreement to a publishing contract that defines or changes the terms of the
contract, often focusing on the transfer of copyright ownership. For authors of
scholarly works, an author addendum to a publisher’s standard publication
contract may be necessary to help ensure that authors protect important
rights, such as the right to post their articles online to a personal website or in
a digital repository; the right to use their works within a classroom setting; or
the right to use their works as the foundation for future research. (​

Such journals are known as "hybrid journals." (​
Source: MIT​
)
● Library-based publishing ​
- Many academic libraries are now beginning to act
as publishers for scholarly works produced in their institutions and elsewhere.
In some cases, the library works with the university scholarly press to publish
works. In other cases, the library publishes works independently or separately
from the academic press. Library-based publishers are often strongly in favor
of Open Access. (​
Library Publishing Coalition​
)

Peer Review
● Peer review - ​
a process by which a research article is vetted by experts in
community before publication. (​
Sense About Science​
)

article has been formally published.
● Transferable peer review - ​
reviews that travel with a paper if it is rejected
from a journal. (​

● Double blind peer review - ​
when the reviewers don't know who the authors
are, and vice versa.
● Registered Reports - ​
A type of publication in which ​
peer review of the

papers then are guaranteed publication in the journal if the authors follow
through with the registered methodology (​
Source​
)

Assessment And Metrics
● Altmetrics - ​
Altmetrics are alternative ways of recording and measuring the
use and impact of scholarship. Rather than solely counting the number of
times a work is cited in scholarly literature, alternative metrics also measure
and analyze social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogs, wikis, etc.), document
downloads, links to publishing and unpublished research, and other uses of

of published papers for an academic. (​
Wikipedia​
)
Journal level metrics - ​
metrics that apply to all papers published within a
journal. A common example is Thomson Reuters’ journal impact factor.

Article Processing Charge, many publishers or journals will offer partial or total
waiving for fees.
● Derivative work ​
- A work based upon one or more pre-existing works, such as

● Double-dipping ​
- In the context of Open Access, double-dipping occurs when a
journal has an article processing charge (APC) for publishing an author’s work,
as well as requiring payment (usually through a subscription fee) by the
potential user of the work. This model makes the institution or author pay
twice to access the work. (​
